   Now, you can enjoy those nifty AMIGA, MAC and ATARI sounds on your PC.  
SOUND.EXE will directly play MAC and ATARI sounds, but AMIGA sounds must be 
converted to the MAC/ATARI format with the included program, SNDCVT.EXE.  
Both SOUND.EXE and SNDCVT.EXE will display some help if run them without 
any command-line parameters.  One of my favorite uses of SOUND.EXE is in my 
autoexec.bat.  I run SOUND.EXE from autoexec and play "Gooooooood Morning 
Vietnam" upon boot-up.  You can make up a bunch of batch files to play 
various sounds.  That way you don't have to bother with all the parameters 
each time you want to playback a sound.

     These programs are freely distributable as long as you don't make ANY 
cash profit from them (you can trade them.)  Do not send me any money 
either, but I would appreciate hearing how SOUND.EXE performs on machines I 
haven't tried it on yet.

     SOUND.EXE will play any file as sound, not just the digitized sounds 
of the AMIGA, MAC, and ATARI.  This means you can create your own sound 
files (like from BASICA or if you have a sound sampler, etc.) and play them 
with SOUND.EXE on your PC.  SOUND.EXE ignores any header data in the sound 
file and definitely will not produce the correct sound from a file that has 
been delta or Fibonacci compressed.  Fortunately, most sound files I've 
seen are not compressed.  Since the programs tell you the input format when 
you run them, I won,t repeat it here.

     Since different PCs have various CPU rates, you will have to 
experiment with the period parameter to get the sound to play at the right 
rate.  I suggest that you start with a small period and work up until you 
find the correct one.  Once you've got it then you can twiddle the filter 
number.  The default filter number (7) is pretty good for most machines.  
On slower machines a filter number of 6 may sound better and on faster 
machines a filter number of 8 may sound better -- experiment.  When the 
program is making sound it disables system interrupts because they 
adversely affect the sound quality.  That means that you can't stop the 
sound with a CTRL-C, BREAK, or ever CTRL-ALT-DEL.  So, if you enter a too 
long period or too many repeats you will have to turn off the machine to 
stop the sound -- or just wait till its over.

     The file format SOUND.EXE expects is just a sequential file of bytes.  
Each byte represents the sound intensity from 0 to 255.  For instance, if 
you wanted to make a sound file of just a sinewave you would make the 
sinewave vary from 0 to 255 at a specific frequency.

     This program will play sounds through the internal PC speaker.  No, 
the sound isn't as good as on those "artsy" machines, but its a whole lot 
better than you are used to from your PC.  If you're like me, you've 
probably tried some program on your PC that is supposed to generate speech 
or some other sophisticated (read nifty) sound.  After hearing how horrible 
it sounded you probably decided that making nifty sounds wasn't one of the 
PC's abilities.  Well, that is partially true, but there are always ways of 
pushing hardware to its limits and getting better performance out of it.

     Unlike many other PC sound making/playing programs, this one uses 
variable-rate pulse-width modulation (VRPWM) to fool the PC's speaker into 
generating better sounds.  Unfortunately, the PC's speaker is connected to 
the output of a digital circuit which can only turn it on or off (obviously 
designed by a thermostat company.)  This is great for making all those dull 
mechanical beeps and buzzes we're so used to, but its terrible for making 
normal sounds (like Robin Williams' famous "Goooooood Morning Vietnam!!!".)

     Fortunately, due to the nature of the VRPWM method used, the sound 
quality is directly proportional to the PC's processor speed and somewhat 
proportional to the speaker's electro-mechanical properties.  (Bear with me 
on this.  I just hate it when people try to simplify technical stuff for 
me.  Kinda implies I'm a moron or something.)  Anyway, the faster your 
processor is, the better the sound quality (ie you get your money's worth.)  
So, if you bought a super-duper 50MHz 386/387 machine for word-processing 
(don't laugh -- this is a common industry practice. Seriously!) your 
machine will sound great, but if you're still tied to a 4.77Mhz IBM (or 
compatible) there is a slight chance that you may possibly be disappointed.          

     Fear not though.  I have tried this out on lots of (well a few, 
anyway) machines and haven't been disappointed with the sound quality.  
That includes my NEC MultiSpeed portable (9.54 MHz, V30), an IBM AT (6 MHz, 
80286), an IBM AT (8 MHz, 80286), a COMPAQ 386SX (16 MHz, 80386SX), and a 
COMPAQ 386 DeskPro (16 MHz, 80386).  I haven't tried it on any 4.77 MHz, 
8088 machines or XT-type machines.  

    Yes, the 386 machines and most of the 286 machines at work are used 
exclusively for word-processing.  The engineers are allowed to use the 
older (6 MHz) computers for engineering purposes (when they are not being 
used for word-processing.)  Consequently, I have to wait all day for a 
fractal to be generated while the secretary's COMPAQ 386/20 wastes millions 
of powerful CPU cycles waiting for each painfully slow keystroke of text.  
This is an industry practice!  AARRGGHHH!!!!  Okay, enough bitching.


                            Hope ya enjoy it.
